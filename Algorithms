### LEHMER ALGORITHM ###
########################

1. generate a new seed.

2. pass the seed to a function.

3. calculate a new seed through this function and return it.

4. add the seed on a vector (if this seed is the second).

5. go back to the step one.

1_obs.: repeat the calculation for six times.
2_obs.: the first seed will not be moved to the vector, only the six after it.
